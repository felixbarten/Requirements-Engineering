This page is where we keep any particular data we've gathered during our activities. The general structure is to have a question and use the data we've gathered to provide meaningful and rich answers to the question. Some parts may deviate from this because they may not be directly related to any question we have formulated but we feel that they may become important in the future.

# Course Goal

Develop your own method for requirements engineering that emphasizes your strengths and minimizes your weaknesses


# Glossary

- DLE - Digital Learning Environment
- UvA - University of Amsterdam

# Essential Data

- There is general model for the way education works and education existed long before the use of DLEs.

- There is some research that shows that DLEs improve the learning process

- About 20% of UvA Teachers do not use blackboard at all due to some internal motivation

- The remaining teachers use blackboard's mostly basic features for course content management and only use more if it has been empirically proven to have a positive impact on education

- The UvA originally choose Blackboard due to it being a market leader at the time and it was primarily IT-driven

- The UvA's digital infrastructure has changed very much since the adoption of blackboard

# Project Plan

A project plan contains the following:

- A list of deliverable products
- A list of activities to be performed
- There are dates and times associated with the deliverable products and activities
- There is allocation/scheduling of resources

# Questions and Answers

## How satisfied is the UvA with blackboard?

### How satisfied are students?

#### Does blackboard in any way influence the student course evaluations?

### How satisfied are teachers?

## What are different ways that students and teachers use blackboard?

### Is there possibly a reason relating to differences in faculties, teachers and courses that may explain the non-uniform setup of courses on blackboard?

## What is actually the effect of digital learning environment on an educational institution like the UvA?

### What would a model be like for an institution that performs well with a sub-par DLE ?

### What would a model be like for an institution that performs well with a relatively good DLE ?

### What would a model be like for an institution that performs well without a DLE ?

### What would a model be like for an institution that performs poorly with a relatively good DLE ?

## How does a DLE/blackboard affect the performance of students?

### Are there students which have been affected negatively by blackboard? And in what degree? E.G due to usability issues
