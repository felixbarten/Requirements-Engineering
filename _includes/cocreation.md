# Co creation observations


## Co creation session 1 Adrian Kevin

First there was time to individually think of things that would be done witn blackboard. After collecting these suggestions groups of 3 or 4 were formed and assigned a task. The goal was to design a user interface for the task. This UI should contain all the functionalites required to perform the task. after drawing the user interfaces each one was presented to the class and it was asked of the students to evaluate if this would work for them. 


## Co creation session 2 Spiros and Andre

Used nominal group theory to organize the workshop. Each person had to answer the following question: What are the functionalities for the simplest blackboard system?" However this question was ambiguous which created some interesting answers. After some time to deliberate the answers these answers were collected on the board and people could give either 3 points, 2 points or 1 point to 3 of these funcitonalities. 

Unfortunately this approach did not yield a lot of useful information as the most important functionality "access course material" was voted the highest and left only two other functionalities to be voted. 

A more sensible approach would have been to determine for each functionality if they were truly necessary to conform to a truly minimal DLO system.

Create a user interface for different purposes.

The premise:

Blackboard is a portal for a variety of different web based services. What do you include on the main page?

3 groups of students each with a different assignment on what the right UI composition would be. One group had Hans to explore the teacher's side of things.
