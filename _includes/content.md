#Week 1

## Observations made by Felix Barten

Assignment: 

Observe how you use blackboard. Log your observations, and make two or three relevant aggregations and visualisations. Carefully choose what you will log.

How to determine what to log:

1. You are looking for improvements. Monitor for effectiveness (understanding), inefficiencies (effort), imperfections, annoyances.
2. You are looking for opportunities. IT can foster interactivity (personalised content), collaboration, innovation in behaviour, tools and culture. 

### General impressions of using blackboard

While I've used a number of different learning management systems during prior studies I have never worked with Blackboard before. After eight weeks of using blackboard a few things have become apparent to me. In general the Blackboard works reasonably well compared to other things I experienced. However there are a few obvious flaws in the system. 

### Usage 

I use the Blackboard system to accesscourse information, assignments, grades and relevant materials of courses im currently following. 

### Functionality

* Navigation could be better (buttons that seem clickable aren't and the other way around)
* Random outage times (Sunday for 3-5 hours and on a monday evening)

### Annoyances

* Logged out EVERY TIME and doesn't redirect back to login, instead gives a generic error.
* Can't submit files when you want to 
* Errors that can't be explained. 
* Sometimes functionalities just don't work in a single browser
