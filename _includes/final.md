# Introduction

This document is organized into several different sections based on activities we have performed during the course. Within those sections the content is futher divided into weeks. At the end of this there is conclusion provided. 

# Assignments

## Week 1

### Description: 

Observe how you use blackboard. Log your observations, and make two or three relevant aggregations and visualisations. Carefully choose what you will log.

How to determine what to log:

1. You are looking for improvements. Monitor for effectiveness (understanding), inefficiencies (effort), imperfections, annoyances.
2. You are looking for opportunities. IT can foster interactivity (personalised content), collaboration, innovation in behaviour, tools and culture. 


### Individual logs 

#### Observations made by Felix Barten

##### General impressions of using blackboard

While I've used a number of different learning management systems during prior studies I have never worked with Blackboard before. After eight weeks of using blackboard a few things have become apparent to me. In general the Blackboard works reasonably well compared to other things I experienced. However there are a few obvious flaws in the system. 

##### Usage 

I use the Blackboard system to access course information, assignments, grades and relevant materials of courses I'm currently following. 

##### Functionality

Even though the basic functionality blackboard provides is sufficient I did have a few problems with some points: 

* Navigation could be better (buttons that seem clickable aren't and the other way around)
* Random outage times (Sunday for 3-5 hours and on a monday evening)

##### Annoyances

I have noticed a few annoying things about blackboard in the eight weeks I've used the system: 

* When the system logs out the user, the user is not notified but instead will get a generic error. This could be replaced by a redirect function if the user tries to access a part of blackboard after the session has expired. 
* Can't submit files because the system won't let you. This happened quite often when submitting assignments.
* Errors that can't be explained. 
* Sometimes submitting a form doesn't work. No explanation is given but it will inexplicably work in a different browser. 

#### Observations made by Joel James Bartholomew

- I use blackboard to access course assignments, course material and to submit assignments.Sometimes I use it to see grades
 
- I dislike the fact that it constantly gives you access denied due to logging users out automatically after a short time.
 
- There are some compatibility issues with popular browsers like Google chrome
 
- The user interface is not the most intuitive in a number places. E.G: It is sometimes not sure that items are clickable such as:

 ![Screenshot](../images/blackboardscreenshot.png)
  

  *The following is a table depicting the average number of times I visit blackboard per day*

  <table>
  <th>Day</th>
  <th>Average number of visits</th>
  <tr><td>Monday</td><td>0</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Tuesday</td><td>0</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Wednesday</td><td>4</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Thursday</td><td>2</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Friday</td><td>1</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Saturday</td><td>0</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Sunday</td><td>3</td></tr>
  </table>

The usage amounts are probably due to the fact that blackboard was never actually used for the Software testing course while the Software Architecture course made full use of blackboards. The amount of visits on Sunday is most likely due the fact my group often turned in assignments on that day and I seem to have a tendency of leaving everything to the last minute.

## Week 2

RESEARCH: [2 hours] (group)
Spend two hours on the web and in the (digital) library to make sense of the domain and what possibilities there are to make this better.

### Course Goal

Develop your own method for requirements engineering that emphasizes your strengths and minimizes your weaknesses

### Glossary

- DLE - Digital Learning Environment
- UvA - University of Amsterdam

### Essential Data

- There is general model for the way education works and education existed long before the use of DLEs.

- There is some research that shows that DLEs improve the learning process

- About 20% of UvA Teachers do not use blackboard at all due to some internal motivation

- The remaining teachers use blackboard's mostly basic features for course content management and only use more if it has been empirically proven to have a positive impact on education

- The UvA originally choose Blackboard due to it being a market leader at the time and it was primarily IT-driven

- The UvA's digital infrastructure has changed very much since the adoption of blackboard

### Blended learning 

What does this term even mean? Apparently some combination of face to face classes and digital methods such as web/mobile apps. 

### Blackboard

Blackboard has the most market share when it comes learning management systems.

The new version of Blackboard learn has a more "modern" user interface.

The UvA has about 20% who don't use blackboard. That's a pretty large amount of the faculty staff.

### DLE Marketshare 2014

1. Blackboard
2. Moodle
3. DesireToLearn

### Hogeschool van Amsterdam

Due to being previously being students of the HvA we also looked into some information regarding their use of DLE. 

 The Hogeschool van Amsterdam  uses a large amount of different types of learning environments and even has a special department known as "Onderwijs lab" that researches new teaching methods.

*The HvA uses*:

- Chamilo
- DWLO (Sharepoint)
- Moodle

### Questions we have come up with

#### How satisfied is the UvA with blackboard?

##### How satisfied are students?

##### Does blackboard in any way influence the student course evaluations?

##### How satisfied are teachers?

#### What are different ways that students and teachers use blackboard?

##### Is there possibly a reason relating to differences in faculties, teachers and courses that may explain the non-uniform setup of courses on blackboard?

#### What is actually the effect of digital learning environment on an educational institution like the UvA?

##### What would a model be like for an institution that performs well with a sub-par DLE ?

##### What would a model be like for an institution that performs well with a relatively good DLE ?

##### What would a model be like for an institution that performs well without a DLE ?

##### What would a model be like for an institution that performs poorly with a relatively good DLE ?

#### How does a DLE/blackboard affect the performance of students?

##### Are there students which have been affected negatively by blackboard? And in what degree? E.G due to usability issues


## Week 3

### Description

Requirements Engineering plan:

A RE plan should focus on what you want to know. Think of the questions and claims that are important for you in this project. Identify which questions you have already answered to what extent and how reliable that answer is. Then plan what questions you want to have answered for this and next week and how you will get the answer. Make sure the answers to these questions are important to Richard vd Wurff. For the claims: which could you refute.

Questions could be:

- What characteristics of users and usage are important to consider for the selection of a new system 
- What are the essential services and features of a blackboard system
- How good does the current blackboard system support the UvA goals
- How will the new blackboard system contribute to the goals of UvA 
- Which type of usability problems will lead to problems in education (make it SMART)  
- Which type of usability problems might be annoying but have no impact on education

Claims you could try to refute:

- More and better use of educational tools will improve education
- If the DLO will make educational tools easy to apply, these will be applied more in the classroom  
- A stratified use of Blackboard will improve student satisfaction
- A stratified use of Blackboard will improve study behaviour

Prepare Co-creation: 

In the workshop from this week we will discuss some techniques to co-create (design in this case) a new system. You will have to do a co-creation session next week. Please prepare for this. Activities: read, learn, plan. Output: a script for the co-creation session 

## Requirements Engineering plan

Questions we've already answered in this project: 

- What characteristics of users and usage are important to consider for the selection of a new system 
    We've come to the conclusions that all the students that use the system do so to access information about courses, look at assignments, deliver assignments and get their grades. This answer is only valid for the students but the students don't represent the whole range of end users. We have no data about what the lecturers want when they have interactions with the system.
- Which type of usability problems might be annoying but have no impact on education?
    We've asked questsions to access this in the previous weeks. Almost every student has trouble finding information on blackboard. However noone claimed to have suffered less performance during a course because of it. These answers came from every student we interviewed and are likely to be reliable as a whole. However the sample size is too small to be sure. 

What questions we would like to answer:

- How does blackboard usage affect course evaluations? 
    This question might be easier to calculate with statistics from the blackboard system and UvA's statistics about the gradings of courses.
    These statistics could only answer how much content was made available through blackboard though, not how well blackboard was utilized during the course. With asking these questions we hope to get some answers and maybe some preliminary data on how much blackboard matters when evaluating the grade for a course. 

These are questions and claims we sought to answer/prove/refute this week:

- Which type of usability problems might be annoying but have no impact on education

  - What type of usability problems have students experienced while working with blackboard?

- Which type of usability problems will lead to problems in education (make it SMART)  

  - Has a student at any point in time have their performance during a course be negatively impacted due to a usability issue with blackboard?

- A stratified use of Blackboard will improve student satisfaction

  - Does blackboard in any way influence the student course evaluations?

    - Has a student rated a number of courses very highly that made little of use of blackboard?

    - Does the evaluation form have any questions that refer to the use of blackboard during the course?

- A stratified use of Blackboard will improve study behaviour

  - How does a DLE/blackboard affect the performance of students?
  
    -  Are there students which have been affected negatively by blackboard? And in what degree? E.G due to usability issues

- More and better use of educational tools will improve education

  - What are concrete examples of the use of educational tools affecting education positively?

  - Are there concrete examples of the use of educational tools affecting education negatively?

- If the DLO will make educational tools easy to apply, these will be applied more in the classroom

  - Does blackboard currently make it difficult to use educational tools?

  - How eager are teachers to use educational tools?

### Co-creation script

#### Goal

During our co-creation session we seek to prove/refute the following claims:

- Which type of usability problems might be annoying but have no impact on education?
    - What type of usability problems have students experienced while working with blackboard?

- Which type of usability problems will lead to problems in education? 
    - Has a student at any point in time have their performance during a course be negatively impacted due to a usability issue with blackboard?


The goal of the workshop will be to design the most unusable digital learning environment system. One with functionalities that are difficult enough to use that they actually affect one's productivity. There are constraints in the sense that you cannot say the feature just does not work and a scenario cannot take an infinite amount of time to complete. Ideally, the system would still pose issues even for seasoned users of the system.

#### Script

To achieve this we will do the following:

- Seperate the workshop members into groups (5 in total).
 
- Use force-fitting and assign each student a different aspect of the DLE (These will be the basic functionality of blackboard that we have gathered from our interviews)
 
- The students must then come up with steps required for that part of the system with intention of ending up with a system with lowest usability level possible. (Time limit of 5 minutes)

- Once the time limit is up, we will go through each scenario and decide which ones are worst when it comes to a user’s productivity along with asking other people in the workshop of ways they can think of making the scenario worse.

#### Expectations:

##### Possible Result 1:

No one can really come up with a nonusable scenario. This implies that is difficult to come up with real usability issues that affect productivity.

##### Possible Result 2:

 We end up with a nice set of functionalities with a low level of usability and we can analyze these to see which of these are present in blackboard and actually affect students. People often use past experiences to come up with idea so we can assume that they will gain at least some experience of usability effects

##### Possible Result 3:

 We end up up with very differing opinions on usability when going through the list of scenarios at the end of the session which shows how subjective usability can be.


#### Functionality:

1. The posting of announcements
2. Creating course assignments (Teachers)
3. Submitting assignments (Students)
4. Organizing course material (Teachers) E.G. documents, lectures notes/slides
5. Taking/doing Quizes/Tests (Students)
    

#### Time:

Workshop has a max duration of 20 minutes and will then be followed by 10 minutes feedback round.

## Reflection

### Felix

While the goal of this exercise was to become familiar with interviewing people. Interviewing (on video) was relatively new to me because it was never required to interview strangers for previous assignments. Because the assignment was to conduct interviews without any preparation we did just that, however I feel like there would be more beneficial information uncovered if there was a short preparation before the interviews. A lot of the times I forgot which questions to ask next or would get confused where I was in an interview and this could have probably been prevented with some preparation time. 

However it wasn't that hard to get useful answers, however most people found that the blackboard system wasn't that bad to begin with for their day to day uses. However I did not really drill down that much because that wasn't the whole assignment but in retrospect I probably should have drilled down a bit further because there was more information available. Overall I don't think I did that badly but it could have gone a lot better so there are lots of opportunities to improve! 

### Joel

The interviews were not conducted with a particular goal in mind that was known to both parties. An experiment could be done to make it clear and see if that leads to more fruitful interviews.

It seems to be effective to draw on the person's past experience. The answers were well-thought-out yet concise this was probably due to the interviewee already being familiar with the interviewer.

The location of an interview seems to also have an effect on the type of answers you receive. For example closed spaces can lead to the interviewee being more reserved and less likely to openly share their answer it would probably be a good to idea to look more closely at the effect of the location/setting
on the answers provided. 

## Findings

During the interviews we found some questions are more efficient than others at eliciting a response from the interviewee. Very broad questions like: "What don't you like about blackboard" sometimes work great and other times don't result in any useful information. While some of these questions could be stepping stones to a more drilled down approach for these questions the questions usually aren't that effective. 

The question "Do you have any prior experience with a system like blackboard?" usually gives a good response because if the participant already has experience with other systems he or she might have more knowledge of the functionalities the other systems posess and might have some suggestions for extra features of blackboard. 

The question "What do you use blackboard for?" resulted in the same response for all the participants of the interviews. They all use the system to obtain information about the courses. Especially course materials, assignments and grades.

The question "How often do you use blackboard?" yielded some mildly interesting results. Two out of three people said that they avoid using the system as often as possible. This is a good indication that there might be something wrong with blackboard.

## Week 2

### Preparation 

To prepare for the interviews we first went over the interesting questions from last week. 

* Do you have any prior experience with a system like blackboard?
* How often do you use blackboard?
* What do you use blackboard for?
* What do you miss in blackboard?

We've come up with a few additional questions. 

1. What functionality do you expect from a digital learning environment? 
* Have you ever tried the mobile version of blackboard?
* Do you find blackboard easy to use? 
    1. Has the usability of blackboard ever affected your performance in a course?
* Have you ever had a teacher who did not use blackboard primarily?
    1. What did he/she use instead of blackboard?
    * Do you feel that was better or worse for the course? How about your performance in the course?
* Have you ever found a course difficult because of something related to blackboard?

* Do you feel that a unified experience is important for courses? 
    1. Have you ever lost time because of the fact you had to become used to or learn a teacher's particular way of working with blackboard/ some other system?

Our approach for the interviews for week 2 is a bit of free form (partial free form) with a defined set of questions to ask for structure. We will ask the following questions in roughly this order:

1. Who are you and what do you study?
2. Are you familiar with the blackboard system?
3. What do you use blackboard for?
4. How often do you consult blackboard? 
5. Do you have any prior experience with a system like blackboard?
6. Have you ever had a teacher who did not use blackboard primarily?
    * What did he/she use instead of blackboard?
7. Is there something you feel that is blackboard is lacking as a digital learning environment?
8. Do you find blackboard easy to use? 
    * Has the usability of blackboard ever affected your performance in a course?
9. Have you ever found a course difficult because of something related to blackboard?
    * Do you feel that was better or worse for the course? How about your performance in the course?
10. Do you feel that a unified experience is important for courses? 
    * Have you ever lost time because of the fact you had to become used to or learn a teacher's particular way of working with blackboard/ some other system?

### Apprenticing the customer

After reading the paper to become familiar with the apprenticeship role we decided it could be implemented to elicit requirements in an interview. The interview will follow roughly the same outline as the one described above with a different main activity. The interviewee will be asked to perform some simple tasks in blackboard and will be asked questions about actions he or she takes to navigate the website. 

Questions:

1. Would you be willing to show us how you normally access blackboard?
2. Can you show us how you access blackboard when you are looking for course material?

## Observations 

Many students seem to complain about the usability of blackboard but from all of the interviews today most seemed to be satisfied with the features provided and they apparently have never been impacted negatively because the UvA uses blackboard. One particular student said that they would also like to have class schedules integrated with blackboard but that was more of just a small preference and there was no real clear reason aside from having access to more features from one place. Two of the students we interviewed also said that they used blackboard extensively which is somewhat in contrast to the interviews from the previous week but this may be due to students being from different faculties where one is more technically inclined than the other.

### Questions analysis

**Question: 1. Who are you and what do you study?**

The opening question didn't yield any interesting results. Although there was a pattern in our subjects. Everyone we interviewed this week started to use blackboard at UvA in the last two months, they were all in their first year at UvA. Although we picked people at random based on their availability it could be nice to see if it's possible to get someone with more experience in blackboard. The experienced users could have the same experiences as the relatively new users but they could also have been exposed to more functionalities within blackboard as they followed more courses and courses tend to differentiate somewhat from one another.

**Question: 2. Are you familiar with the blackboard system?**

Also not a shocking conclusion: they were all familiar with blackboard.

**Question: 3. What do you use blackboard for?**

This answer yielded all the same results as last week's interviews. Students use blackboard to access information on their courses, assignements and grades. 

**Question: 4. How often do you consult blackboard?**

This question yielded the same response as last week with a minor change. The respondents said they use it every day for their studies but they didn't say this was a bad thing whereas people we interviewed last week said they would use only when they had to becuase they didn't like spending that much time in the system.

**Question: 5. Do you have any prior experience with a system like blackboard?**

When we asked this question a few (other) systems came up but the systems that did come up were incomparible to blackboard because their scope was smaller and contained less functionalities. 

**Question: 6. Have you ever had a teacher who did not use blackboard primarily?**

No one out of our interviewed students had teachers that deviated from blackboard. This was kind of surprising due to personal experiences with these sort of things but plausible. 

**Question: 6.1. What did he/she use instead of blackboard?**

No answers. 

**Question: 7. Is there something you feel that is blackboard is lacking as a digital learning environment?**

One person said he would like an addition to blackboard in the form of a roster application. In the current environment there is another application that fulfills this information need and will need to be accessed separately from blackboard.


**Question: 8. Do you find blackboard easy to use?**

All students found blackboard easy to use except for finding files. However noone reported to ever have been unable to find anything without some help from fellow students or the teacher. 


**Question:  8.1. Has the usability of blackboard ever affected your performance in a course?**

No answers.


**Question: 9. Have you ever found a course difficult because of something related to blackboard?**

None of the interviewers had this problem. 


**Question: 9.1. Do you feel that was better or worse for the course? How about your performance in the course?**

No answers.


**Question: 10. Do you feel that a unified experience is important for courses?**

One person said it would help a little bit but that it wouldn't solve the usability problems blackboard is currently experiencing. 


**Question: 10.1. Have you ever lost time because of the fact you had to become used to or learn a teacher's particular way of working with blackboard/some other system?**

No Answers

## Reflection

### Felix 

I've conducted one interview this week. My interview was a mix of a regular interview and some part of it was dedicated to the apprenticing the customer paper. There are a few pitfalls when using this method. The interviewer needs to feign ignorance in order to let the customer show him to do the work. I don't think I completely succeeded in this aspect of the exercise. Sometimes I would help the interviewee out by pointing out more efficient ways to do things. When doing this interview I asked the interviewee if she could show me how to access her assignments. I chose this activity because it was always the most prevalent answer whenever we asked what the students used blackboard for. And this is of course one of the main functionalities of the system. Although the answer was good I don't think we used the method's full potential for the interview. There were more interactions possible although a student's interaction with blackboard might be quite simple (see assignments, course info etc...).

### Joel

In contrast to the previous week we prepared some questions and topics to cover during the interviews. It seems as if this makes it much easier to conduct an interview but we were still somewhat directionless due to the fact that we did not quite have clear research questions for requirements we wanted to have answered during the interviews. It also seemed that during my interviews in particular I had some issues conducting keeping them going smoothly and found it difficult to drill down into topics.

## Week 3

### Interview Overview

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Iyp01ZwPR7k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


### Findings

From the students we interviewed some of them did not claim to be impacted negatively and even one them said it impacted it them positively because it provided them easy access to all course materials. There were also no students who said that the use of blackboard or lack of use of blackboard affected them as they were filling in the course evaluation form for their worse and best evaluated subject. Due to the fact that we found no students who have had teachers that did use educational tools that were not blackboard or their own website it was not really possible to determine if the use of educational tools result in the improvement of education. We did manage to find a Teacher who seemed to be quite frustrated with the usability of blackboard which is a stark contrast to the other people we have interviewed in the best. The teacher also found it difficult to understand why this particular faculty of the UvA would use a system such as blackboard with an outdated user interface. 

### Reflection

The interviews this week resulted in different results because we managed to interview one teaching assistant and one active teacher of the university. The provided us with more information than in the previous weeks in which we only interviewed other students.

#### Felix

I conducted two interviews this week. The interviews were with a graduated Physics student who is now a Teaching Assistant (TA) and with a PhD student of AI and Law. It was nice to interview people with a different perspective on the blackboard system. In previous weeks we mostly interviewed students with almost no prior experience or a rather short span in which they used blackboard for their studies. In my opinion the interviews I conducted went reasonably well. I think we got some added value by also receiving the teacher's information as they are also a major stakeholder in the blackboard system. 

#### Joel

The one interview I did this week was kind of disappoiting in the sense that I couldn't use all of the questions I prepared beforehand due to the student not quite remembering the evaluations that they have given to courses and forced me to somewhat improvise. I did not do as well as I had liked but I did manage to learn that blackboard was unlikely to have influenced their course evaluations. Near the end I also managed to steer the interview in a direction that allowed me to gain more information about how the student feels about teacher's who use their own website instead of blackboard and how he preferred that as it showed that the teachers we more dedicated in providing simple access to course related documents.

# Reading assignments

## Week 1

### Reading Assignments

#### Felix 

- 1.1 What are for this assignment the obvious sources of information to find requirements and make sense of your assignment for the first four weeks.

    Obvious sources of information are:

    * Users (students, teachers)
    * IT Department
    * UvA management 
    * Users of other types of systems at other learning institutions (with likely similar goals for a learning management system) 
    * Maintainers/developers of the blackboard system

- 1.2 Think of three important questions for your project that you can not likely answer by going to these sources.

    * What is the main goal of blackboard?
    * What role does blackboard play in UvA's vision?
    * What current alternatives for the blackboard system are available now on the market? 


#### Joel 

- 1.1 What are for this assignment the obvious sources of information to find requirements and make sense of your assignment for the first four weeks.
  
  The most apparent sources requirement information for this assignment are students and teachers. They are the two types of people who interact with blackboard and will interact with its replacement. The assignment can be seen as finding out what the requirements are for the system replacing blackboard so that the goal, which is the transition to and integration of the new system, can go smoothly. This assignment also provides an opportunity to see how well blackboard has done as system and use that information when selecting its successor.

- 1.2 Think of three important questions for your project that you can not likely answer by going to these sources.
  
  - Why was the choice made to use blackboard?

  - What was the original goal of using blackboard?

  - What are possible candidates that could replace blackboard?

  
#### 1.3 Activities plan 

- 1.3 Read the required reading. Look at the overall assignment for the first four weeks. Plan your requirements activities for the first four weeks. Provide a short rationale, referring to the documents you’ve read._

**Step 1: Identify stakeholders**

This is done in attempt to determine all the people who are relevant to the problem and need to be involved in the requirements engineering process

**Step 2: Determine the most important stakeholders due time contraints we cannot deal with all stakeholders (Contextual design)**
   
This step will be taken due to time constraints imposed on the requirement engineers in the assignment's lifespan. By prioritizing the stakeholders there will be more time to dedicate to the more important stakeholders to make sure the system's resulting functionalities are in line with their expectations. 


**Step 3: Create a sketch of the system-as-is by looking at the features provided by blackboard and how it is used in the problem world. (Setting the scene)**

This is done to properly understand the current solutions provided by the system for the problem world. We can use this to assess the overall effect of blackboard on the problem domain.

**Step 4: Determine the original goal behind the use of blackboard by examing to the application domain (Contextual design)**

This point is to gain a frame of reference to determine what the goal of the new system is so that we can determine which are important in reaching that particular goal.
    
**Step 5: Check to see if blackboard managed to achieve it's goal**

This step is performed to ascertain if the system has fulfilled it's goal. This information will be obtained through interviews with the prioritized stakeholders. 

We have chosen to obtain this information because it can be used in later steps to help measure new solutions. 
    If the organisational goals were reached with the current system the new system should excel at other aspects and also contain all the functionality previously provided. 
    If the system didnt satisfy those goals the criteria that weren't met can be examined for additional requirements that can be used to measure the new system.
    
**Step 6: Check to see if the goal has changed by use of contextual inquiry and interviewing stakeholders (Contextual design)**

This step will result into a view of the current state of the problem world to see if the original goal behind blackboard still has a basis in the reality of the current application domain.

**Step 7: See if it is possible to achieve blackboard's original goal + a combination of the new goal in a more optimal way by look possibilities in redesigning the work practice (Contextual design)**

Using the information gained during the previous steps we will gather the requirements by looking at the goals of the system and determining which ones are necessary for a success and which requires
    need to be refuted.

**Step 8: Determine/Sketch the requirements relevant for system-to-be (Setting the scene)**

During this step, we will create a model of the requirements that the system needs to fulfill to understand its objectives, regulating laws, deficiencies and limitations, and the system-to-be, to elaborate the requirements on the software-to-be accordingly together with assumptions on the environment.   

## Week 2

### Description

2.1 Explore literature about emphatic listening, active listening and identify five verbal and non verbal cues that stimulate the interviewee in providing elaborate information. 

2.2 Like 2.1 but now identify five cues that stop 

2.3 Apply 2.1 and 2.2 techniques in your interviews and assess your partner on the cues you identified in 2.1 and 2.2

2.4 Explain from the theory how memory works why some of the techniques yield more reliable memories than others

2.5 Experiment with the technique as described with "apprenticing with the customer", can you see that this helps yield more reliable memories?

#### 2.1 

Verbal Cues

1. "Hmmm" 
2. "yes"	 
3. "I see" 
4. "Ah"		
5. "Go on"
6. By periodically summarizing what the person has said the person can provide more information if he/she feels the information is lacking somehow
7. You can generally repeat some of the last words of a sentence to trigger a more elaborate response

The first 6 verbal cues were found in the thesis: Requirements Elicitation Technique by Nisha Jacob.  

Non-verbal cues

1. Nodding at the person. 
2. Smiling
3. Be silent until the person starts talking again


These non-verbal cues were found in the thesis: Requirements Elicitation Technique by Nisha Jacob.  

#### 2.2 

Cues to stop talking about a subject. 

1. Asking to go back to a previous question or subject. 
2. Acknowledging you understand what the interviewee is trying to say and try to move on to the next question. 
3. Basically to take control back from the interviewee by smiling and nodding and asking gently to move the conversation in another direction

These cues were found in the thesis: Requirements Elicitation Technique by Nisha Jacob.  

#### 2.3

Unfortunately we conducted the interviews before the reading assignments. As there was no relation in last week's reading assignments to the interview part of the assignment we did not anticipate that the interview part would be affected by the reading part. 

#### 2.4

Memory is a process that takes part in the whole brain instead of just parts of it as was believed previously. If an event is worthy of being remembered the Hippocampus and the Frontal Cortex will preserve it in long term memory. Whenever your brain stores new memories the physical structure will change slightly to accomodate the new connection. Whenever you retrieve a memory synapse will form between two cells. The more frequently this connection is used the stronger it will grow. As you have more experiences during your lifetime the total amount of connections increases in the brain. 

However not everything we perceive will be stored in memory. A lot of the experiences will be filtered out by our brain, this keeps us sane as we don't have to keep track of every little detail. Whenever you pay attention (a limited resource) it will enable your brain to save this event if it's deemed significant. To become a memory this event will first be stored in short term memory. The short term memory lasts for about 30 seconds. If the memory is important it will gradually be moved to long term memory. If it's transfered to long term memory it can be remembered indefinitely. 

However memory recall is not perfect by any means. A number of things can go awry when trying to recall a memory. The person can simply fail to recall the memory. This can happen if the memory is not encoded well in the memory. Or the person can alter the memory when recalling it.

Memories usually aren't reliable as accounts of eyewitnesses as the person will likely omit vital details like colours. The memory might describe a color as "dark" but this would be hard to match to a real object if the colors do not match with the in memory perceived object. Another thing that might happen is called "memory reconstruction" where a person tries to recall a memory after the fact and fills in the gaps in the memory with information obtained afterwards. This would be very bad if the witness knew who the main suspect is for example because then the gaps can be filled and the witness will believe he/she saw the main suspect. 

#### 2.5 

By using blackboard during the "Apprenticing the customer interview" I had the impression that more subjects or things were pointed out than during an interview without a laptop present. During the interaction with the system a lot of the time there were inquiries or statemetns about buttons of which the user did not know which purpose they served. And some minor annoyances that weren't discussed before hand also appeared during this part of the interview. 

### Joel

#### 2.1 

1. I can understand why you feel or think that way would you like to talk about it?
2. "Hmm" 
3. "I see" 
4. Asking an deep question to clarify what someone is talking about
5. Acknowledging people when they make significant contributions to the interview/discussion

#### 2.2 

1. Not looking at someone when they are speaking
2. Having an expressionless look on your face when someone is speaking
3. Sighing a number of times during a conversation
4. Repeating a question that a person has already provided an answer too
5. Sitting slouched and maybe facing away from the interviewee

#### 2.3

Unfortunately we conducted the interviews before the reading assignments. As there was no relation in last week's reading assignments to the interview part of the assignment we did not anticipate that the interview part would be affected by the reading part. I still tried my best evaluating anyway. 

The camera angle was not the best but from what I tell he faces the other person. He also asks questions to clarify what they have said. There are often times when he says something to confirm what the other person is saying. He did seem to get distracted sometimes during the interview by something but did apologize. Overall, from what I can tell he does well with verbal cues and at least decently well with non-verbal ones.

#### 2.4

Memory is a currently seen as a system-wide process. The brain first determines whether a particular stimulus/event is worth remembering and then proceeds to slightly reconstruct itself to accomodate the new memory. The brain changes it's structure throughout the course of one's lifetime based on their experiences. The more you experience things the better you become at remembering them. It was once believed that when the brain adjusted its synapses to a particular long term memory, that memory would become "consolidated" and was unlikely to change significantly. This was proven to false when lab experiments on rodents showed that even the act of recalling a memory has possible influences on the memory itself. This means that long-term memories can also be changed overtime. For example when someone tells a story of an experience very often and changes little details every time may lead to them having difficulty recalling the original memory.  

When recalling things from memory people also have a tendency to abstract small details away such as habits they have when performing tasks which may lead to inconsistincies with reality

#### 2.5 

During our apprenticeship interview it seemed as if the person's memory of how to perform the task was in someway affected by the fact that we asked them to reproduce it despite the fact that they claimed to have done it many times and have used blackboard extensively during their time at the UvA. We could not exactly see how the technique helped in this situation but this can probably be attributed to the fact that we fell in a number of pitfalls of the apprenticeship method.

## Week 3

Reading questions:

3.1 Sense making: Read the materials about Weick and Klein. Talk to four different students about this course, and find differences about their perception about this assignment and why it helps them achieve the learning goals. Try to explain these differences using the articles of Weick and Klein.

3.2 Decisions: reflect on where you spend your time on the past week. Can you still account for your time spent? Did you spent it wisely? Did you make explicit decisions about it? Can you explain your decision making using the model of naturalistic decision making? 

3.3 Define the goals for the successor of Blackboard using the notation of van Lamsweerde. Quickly map how much you know how to achieve these goals.  



### Felix 

#### 3.1

Before asking the questions to other students I compiled my own answer first: 


>	I chose to enroll in the Msc Software Engineering to understand more about Software Engineering. This course, requirements engineering will enable me in part to enable my goal. The Requirements engineering course will teach me valuable lessons about when you should doubt yourself and how to come to certain conclusions. A part of working as a software engineer is to gather information about what your client (may it be your boss or external clients) wants from a system. While the information on how to do this was supplied before in previous studies I think there is a lot more to be learned about this information gathering process. 
	
> 	This assignment (the replacement of blackboard) will allow me to learn in which areas I can improve in order to get the right requirements when gathering information about a system. Assessing where your knowledge or skill are lacking in a certain area is the first step to improve the skills so I think this will complement my learning goals as I will know which activities to assign more attention to. Another interesting aspect of the assignment are the mandatory interview sessions each week. These interviewing sessions while slightly annoying at first because my lack of interviewing experience and asking strangers to participate will provide valuable experience later when asking customers about assignments while sitting in on meetings for example. 
	
	
>	My perception about the assignment is the following: I like that the assignment is something we as students can relate to. It's familiar because everyone is required to use the blackboard system and will know the good and bad points of blackboard from a  user's perspective. I think this will increase involvement in the exercise as the results could possibly be relayed to the people in charge of the replacing of the system. 

Student 1:

> "I think the questions of the assignment are good but I'm not sure why they aren't accepted for the group work. Otherwise I think they're good questions."

Student 2:

> "My interpretation of the RE assignment is that we should conceive a description of how the UvA can use (modern) technology to facilitate learning and knowledge sharing. Which aspects are important to achieve this — and most important of all — which aspects do not. Should the university rely on common systems or employ a system that is tailored to how the university sees fit? We read a lot of literature to help us guide these choices.  Not all literature is equally important, but this is a good thing since we need to articulate why it is applicable to use certain concepts contained in literature. We are dissecting the body of available knowledge and this learns us to evaluate what we can use and what we can’t."

Student 3:

> "When I chose to to continue studying and start this Master's programme, I primarily wanted to improve myself as a software engineer. This also extends to my learning goals in regards to the course "Requirements Engineering". My learning goal is primarily to find out what possible pitfalls there are during the requirements gathering process. Furthermore, I would like to improve my technique for when it comes to understanding requirements. This assignment gives me an opportunity to find out what my own weaknesses are and what I can do to help mitigate them."

Student 4:

> "My perception about the assignment is that we should be critical in our thinking about requirements in order to discover "true" requirements. I don't know how exactly how this will fit with my overall learning goals."

Student 5:

> "By doing activities each week that we read about from the literature and different papers, listening to real life examples of requirements engineering and getting tactics for elicitation from different guest lecturers, really helps me to get most out of the course material. I feel that the case we are working on (a new BlackBoard system) is something that I can relate to because I have used it. The interviews that are conducted every week really help me shape my interviewing skills, see where I have gone wrong in the past and know how to more easily extract knowledge from people. The book about the psychology of the human mind is really interesting, since you learn about this through the many examples put forth. Even though I did not have a goal of learning about that in the beginning, the course has influenced my goals and perception of what I expect.
Yet sometimes I really feel lost as to what I should do, I feel like I have been thrown in the middle of a project and have trouble figuring out what to do and where to start from, or what is expected of me in the end. That organization is what scares me the most, and lets me believe that I will not achieve my learning goals to the fullest extent."

##### Analysis

I'm not sure how to analyze these differences. One similarity is that different people stated they could possibly not fulfill their learning goals with this course. 


#### 3.2

Our activities this week: 

1. The first thing we did was reading through the assignments to make sure there were no interview related questions in the reading part of the assignment. This caught us by surprise last week and we did not want the same thing to occur this week. 
2. The second thing we spent time on this week is analyzing which questions we could relatively reliably answer. 
3. After analyzing which knowledge we already had we looked at the things in the questions we were asking questions about but could not reliably answer. 
4. Then we looked at how we could improve the reliability of the answers by changing or adding questions to our interview question list.
5. After doing this and revising our questions list with new material we set out to do video interviews. 
6. We looked for interview candidates for about 10 minutes and afterwards reliably found three candidates in quick succession.
7. We conducted the interviews and reflected on the effectiveness of the questions. 

We made explicit decisions to do 1,2,3,4. We think we spent our time wisely to come up with the desired results before thursday's workshop.

*3.1 Sense making: Read the materials about Weick and Klein. Talk to four different students about this course, and find differences about their perception about this assignment and why it helps them achieve the learning goals. Try to explain these differences using the articles of Weick and Klein.*

- Student 1:

> My learning goals are to acquire knowledge and getting a degree. This course focuses in my opinion very much on learning by self-reflection. By being confronted with your own mistakes and having discussions within or outside your own team, you will be able to learn more instead of the teacher telling us what his solution is to requirements engineering. For this assignment we need to use many techniques for decision making which help us to acquire a lot of knowledge in the field of requirements engineering.

- Student 2: 

> I believe that this assignment helps me achieve my goals because it really lets me learn from practical experience rather than only studying the theory. By applying my knowledge in practice I myself can review my work after and see what I did right and wrong. And by doing practical work I can more quickly learn from my mistakes and thus quickly recover from them. I also believe that due to the limited time we have to make the all assignments (because of the dead line on Friday) we need to use our time really efficiently. And due to the short deadline, you could say there is a small crisis situation going on because of all the work which has to be done relatively quickly. This requires that we really think about the things we want to achieve to satisfy the core of the assignments and not waste more time on “gold plating" our assignments.

- Student 3:

> Before taking on this course I was always curious about the techniques a requirement engineer should undertake in order to find out the needs for a software system. I knew conducting interviews was one of the ways to go for, but I never would have realized that there existed a lot of possibilities to gather information from users. At first we were not good at interviewing. The amount of information we got from our interviewees in the first week was very small and they were basically all the information we already knew, but as we started to read the materials on the weekly basis and also participating in the lectures and workshops and using the feedback form our teachers we began to learn quite a lot ways for acquiring useful information from the users. For example we started to get familiar with how the mind works and how the information provided from users may be either incomplete or not even truthful. We began to learn how to use cognitive aids and some cues in order to help the interviewees to provide in formation as much as possible by triggering their minds. One of the main things that helped us achieve our learning goals was using all these information in practice by conducting interviews.

- Student 5:

> Course: SOMEHOW interesting but still a bit confusing. You need to go as far as u can in order to get a deep understanding
of what is an actual requirement and what is not and for sure provide with a good reasoning.

> Assignment: the interesting part of the assignment is that it is real, meaning that it's true that we are looking for the successor of bb, and so there is need to define the system-to-be(in contradiction to architecture, where the assignment was 'virtual'). big disadvantage though: time restriction, which i believe might lead us to inaccurate results.

- Analysis

The differences I found was that the majority of students focus on the practical portion of the statement while talking about their perception. These students were also the ones begun talking by first explicitly stating their goal and explaining how this course would help them achieve it but another student begun by talking about the course in general and everything he has learned so far. It seems as if the students who focused on the practical portion of the course while describing their views are more interested in gaining experience which they can refer to in future when they are actually gathering requirements in the real world. Referring to past experiences and taking decisions based on these situations is very similar to the NDM model described in the paper by Gary Klein, the recognition-primed decision model. Another student described issues with the time allotted to the course assignments and likened it to a "small crisis" in which it is required that they find the core requirements of the assignment which is somewhat discussed in Weick's paper on enactment. 


*3.2 Decisions: reflect on where you spend your time on the past week. Can you still account for your time spent? Did you spent it wisely? Did you make explicit decisions about it? Can you explain your decision making using the model of naturalistic decision making?* 

This week I spent my time the majority of my time on deciding deciding which questions we plan on answering this week and attempting to prepare for the weekly interviews so that we can come up with answers for these questions. I am not confident that it was the best way to spend my time because I still find it difficult to interview people. But we did gain some data that I feel we can use to answer our questions for this week. I don't believe I could explain my decision using the NDM model but it looks more as me attempting to understand the situation by first taking action and dealing with the results that arise. I think it is a form of enactment.
